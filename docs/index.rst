============

Basic tasteful designs for your Django project, with sensible defaults.

Features:

* Themes for plain CSS, Tailwind 4, and Bootstrap 5
* Mobile support
* App layout for content with a complex UI
* Basic menu support

This project won't replace a proper design, but can help make your prototypes pretty.

Pairs particularly well with [nanodjango](https://github.com/radiac/nanodjango/).
